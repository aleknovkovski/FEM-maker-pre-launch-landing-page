## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! That doesnâ€™t look like an email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is probably the first challenge I've done where I didn't learn anything new in the process, merely because I've done everything before, and solved similar issues and problems before.

### Useful resources

- [Josh Comeau on Rems vs Pixels](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/#leveraging-css-variables-15) - This helped me because in here Josh shares a really cool trick to make using Rems easy through leveraging CSS variables. It's a lot nicer than using the 62.5% hack
